      <h3>About the Island</h3>
      <p>
        Taniti is a small tropical island in the Pacific with an area under 500
        square miles. The island features diverse landscapes, including both
        sandy and rocky beaches, dense rainforests, and a mountainous interior
        with a small active volcano. A protected harbor supports local trade and
        tourism. Historically, the economy relied on fishing and agriculture,
        but with a rise in tourism, Taniti has experienced rapid growth in
        hospitality, entertainment, and infrastructure. Visitors often remark on
        the islandâ€™s serene natural beauty and welcoming atmosphere.

      <h3>Culture & Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Taniti is home to approximately 20,000 residents, many of whom belong to
        a rich indigenous culture. While English is widely spoken among younger
        Tanitians, rural areas may have limited English fluency. Healthcare on
        the island includes one central hospital and several multilingual
        clinics. Violent crime is rare, though tourism has brought a small rise
        in pickpocketing. Overall, Taniti remains a safe and friendly
        destination.
